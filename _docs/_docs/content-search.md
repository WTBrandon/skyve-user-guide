Skyve applications include the powerful open-source search library, [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), for indexing and searching both data and content within an application.

By default, all text area fields and uploaded text files are indexed and available to be searched.

### Global Search

To use the global search function from a Skyve application:

1. Login to your application
2. From the top right hand corner, switch to power user mode if not already in there

5. Search results will be returned in order of relevance, showing which document the result was found in and an except of the resulting match
6. Clicking the `data` link will take you to the record which contains the search result
7. Clicking the `content` link will open the uploaded file which contains the search result
